**Assembling the Neon Sign**

1. Design the LED Neon sign in Inkscape and "convert it to path" to be used for Laser Cutting.
2. Laser cut and engrave the design.
3. Plan the LED Neon cuts. Before starting cutting it, try to optimize the connections between the segments, this way there will be fewer wires visible.
4. Prepare the ends of all cut segments.
5. Attach the LED Neon Strip segments to the laser-cut acrylic base.
6. When making interconnections by soldering wires to LED Neon segments, test the connection at each step by applying power to the strip.
7. Connect the 3-Key RGB Led Mini Controller to the Neon LED Strip at one of its ends.
8. Connect the Power Supply to the 3-Key RGB Led Mini Controller
9. Turn On & Play with the LED Neon Sign!



**Hacks & Mods**

One of the most fun hack is to make some part of the [NEON Sign starting flickering, as if it were broken](https://packaged-media.redd.it/c3njt9h5bfp61/pb/m2-res_1080p.mp4?m=DASHPlaylist.mpd&v=1&e=1701302400&s=2a4ae877cdd2963059a9dbd97e02caa254a08c66#t=0), or to make an [Neon Animation](https://youtu.be/XWqpawg0W60?si=L58ajkBC08djIhpI). To do that we will need a Micro-Controller, like Arduino, Micro:bit or Pico.


It's very easy, just program it so that one of its I/O ports simulates a switch that switches between on and off randomly to be similar as a broken one, or programing more than one I/O port to make an animation.

You can use the [MakeCode on-line platform](https://maker.makecode.com/#) to Learning to Code a Micro-Controller like Micro:bit, Pico, etc..
